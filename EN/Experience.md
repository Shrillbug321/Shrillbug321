# My experience
**23 months** is sum of commercial and noncommercial experience. Below I described more detailed.

## Commercial
**14 months** and is this a regular sum of apprenticeships and mandates

## Noncommercial
Here situation is more complicated.<br>
Initially estimated, how much time I spent on **practical** exercises on study. I included only courses related with programming orco najmniej with computer science. <br>
Next I have written down from syllabus number of lessons hours [_In Poland lesson hour = 45 min_]. I use following multiplicators types:
- &lt; 1.00 — only part of course is useful
- 1.00 — all course is useful
- 1.25 — as above and I need take time after classes
- 1.50 — as above and outside regular exercises there was also project
- &gt; 1.50 — I spent too much time, because was improperly organized or high requirements of the lecturer

It came out to 1353.75 lesson hours, or **1015.3125** clock hours.

### Thesis
Here, too, I only count the writing of the solution, not the document.

| Thesis      | Hours                     |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Engineering | 287.4667                  |
| Master      | 207.9333                  |
| Doctoral    | _I joke, I don't have xD_ |
| Sum         | 495.4                     |

### Sum of noncommercial
Total comes out to 1015.3125 + 495.4 = 1510.7125 clock hours.<br>
With 160 working hours per month this works out to 1510.7125 / 160 = **9.44195** months.
[_In Poland working week lasts 5 days of 8 hours each_]

## Summa summarum
Comes out 23.44195 months of experience, but fractional ugly look in CV, then I round to **23 months of experience** :P
